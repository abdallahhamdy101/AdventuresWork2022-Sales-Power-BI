# 🚀 Power BI Sales Dashboard: Direct Query for Real-Time Insights 

### Recently, I developed a sales dashboard that tracks sales performance over the years using Power BI. The standout feature of this dashboard is the utilization of Direct Query connection mode. Direct Query allows measures and visuals to update with new records added to the database in real-time.

Despite these challenges, the dashboard provides valuable insights:

📍 Total Orders

📍 Total Due

📍 Total Tax

📍 Order Percentage by Online Flag

📍 Orders by Sales persons

📍 Order Percentage by Shipping Methods

📍 Sales Performance Over the Years

By leveraging Direct Query, we ensure that our dashboard reflects the most up-to-date data, providing a dynamic and responsive tool for sales analysis.
